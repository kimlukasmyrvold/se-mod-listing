                        This mod was designed to be a flexible framework that will handle nearly all spawning of NPC
                        grids in your game world. It also includes a behavior system that NPCs can use to engage with
                        players and the environment in unique ways. The mod was built to be compatible with existing NPC
                        mods, while also providing new and powerful options to add extra variety and control to how NPC
                        grids appear in the game.

                        AiEnabled is a total NPC inclusion mod that aims to spice up your gameplay by providing you with
                        companions to aid you as well as enemies to hunt you. All NPCs use custom pathfinding logic to
                        perform their assigned role. As ideas flow and time permits, I'll be adding more NPCs to keep
                        things interesting!

                        planets, including modded ones. This mod can theoretically be removed and added at will, but be
                        careful if the planet already has grids on it. Internally, all this mod is doing is removing the
                        "SurfaceDetail" feature from all the planets at startup.

                        This is a quick access context menu, based on the original Build Vision by Jimmacle, designed to
                        supplement the game's terminal. Most of the time, the terminal works just fine for setting up
                        blocks, but sometimes, it's cumbersome. With BV, you can just point and click at a block and
                        have immediate access to its settings, no need to go find a button panel and search for a name
                        you likely can't remember.

                        this. If you have a mod that uses this, then it should be loaded automatically.
